It makes you constantly check your phone, obsess over every tiny update, and become *more* impatient because you\\'re hyper-aware of every moment that passes until your food arrives. It creates a heightened sense of anticipation and a desire for immediate delivery.\\n    *   **The Irony:** The joke highlights the irony that a tool designed to keep us informed about our food delivery actually makes us less able to simply \"wait.\" The person is jokingly claiming that this modern convenience has completely eroded any capacity they might have had for patience, making the therapist\\'s advice utterly unachievable.\\n\\nIn short, the joke is a relatable, self-deprecating jab at how our reliance on real-time tracking and instant updates for things we want (like pizza!) makes it incredibly difficult to cultivate a virtue like patience.'}, next=(), config={'configurable': {'thread_id': '1', 'checkpoint_ns': '', 'checkpoint_id': '1f0ab2ba-df87-69ef-8006-c8f1ebc8e1e9'}}, metadata={'source': 'loop', 'step': 6, 'parents': {}}, created_at='2025-10-17T07:34:13.917089+00:00', parent_config={'configurable': {'thread_id': '1', 'checkpoint_ns': '', 'checkpoint_id': '1f0ab2ba-8450-6fba-8005-37bb457f799b'}}, tasks=(), interrupts=())"

              " 'explanation': 'These are great, clever jokes that play on the characteristics of a samosa! Here\\'s an explanation for each:\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Joke 1 (Playing on \"plot\"):**\\n> Why did the samosa get such rave reviews?\\n> Because it always had a *crisp* opening and a surprisingly *deep plot* inside!\\n\\n*   **Explanation:** This joke plays on two meanings of \"plot\" and \"crisp opening.\"\\n    *   **For a story/movie/book:** A \"crisp opening\" means it starts well and grabs your attention. A \"deep plot\" means the storyline is complex, meaningful, and engaging.\\n    *   **For a samosa:** The *outside* of a samosa is typically *crisp* when fried. The \"opening\" is the first bite. The \"plot\" refers to the *filling* inside. A \"deep plot\" here means the filling is substantial, flavorful, and goes all the way through, giving you a satisfying experience (like a good story).\\n*   **The Humor:** Comes from comparing the physical attributes and experience of eating a samosa to the elements of a well-received story or movie.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Joke 2 (Playing on \"angles\"):**\\n> What\\'s a samosa\\'s favorite subject in school?\\n> Geometry, because it\\'s always *right* angles!\\n\\n*   **Explanation:** This joke relies on the visual shape of a samosa and a common geometry term.\\n    *   **For a samosa:** Samosas are famously *triangular* in shape. Triangles are made up of *angles*. While not all samosa corners are perfectly 90-degree \"right angles,\" they definitely have distinct, sharp angles. The joke playfully implies they *are* right angles.\\n    *   **For geometry:** \"Right angles\" are a fundamental concept in geometry, referring to an angle that measures exactly 90 degrees.\\n*   **The Humor:** It\\'s a pun that connects the distinctive triangular shape of a samosa directly to the mathematical concept of angles, specifically \"right angles,\" implying the samosa *has* them.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Joke 3 (Playing on \"secrets\" and \"filling\"):**\\n> Why did the samosa feel like a secret agent?\\n> Because it always had a *crisp* outer shell protecting a *spicy, hidden agenda*!\\n\\n*   **Explanation:** This joke personifies the samosa as a secret agent, drawing parallels between its structure and a spy\\'s characteristics.\\n    *   **For a secret agent:** A secret agent often has a tough, composed, or impenetrable \"outer shell\" (their demeanor, disguise, or protective gear) to hide their true intentions. They always have a \"hidden agenda\" – a secret mission or plan that is not revealed. \"Spicy\" adds a touch of danger, excitement, or intrigue often associated with spy stories.\\n    *   **For a samosa:** The \"crisp outer shell\" is the fried pastry exterior. The \"spicy, hidden agenda\" refers to the flavorful, often spicy, filling that is *hidden* inside the pastry and is only revealed when you bite into it. The filling is the \"agenda\" or purpose of the samosa.\\n*   **The Humor:** The joke cleverly uses the language of espionage to describe the physical characteristics of a samosa, particularly how its delicious, spicy filling is concealed within its crispy exterior.'}"
